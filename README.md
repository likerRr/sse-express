# SSE express :satellite:
[Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) middleware implementation for [express](http://expressjs.com/)

# Install
`npm install --save sse-express`

The package requires `express`, because it was created directly for the framework. Also it utilizes `ES6` features, so be sure that `node` v5.0+ is installed.

# Usage
Use it simply a middleware for any of your routes. When is used as middleware method `sse()` is added to response object of the route. You can use it to send messages to a client.

```javascript
let sseExpress = require('./sse-express');
//...
app.get('/updates', sseExpress(), function(req, res) {
    res.sse('connected', {
      welcomeMsg: 'Hello world!'
    });
});
`````````

At the client side you can listen to message through `EventSource` instance:

```javascript
let eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:80/updates');

eventSource.addEventListener('connected', (e) => {
    console.log(e.data.welcomeMsg);
    // => Hello world!
});
```

> **Important!** Don't forget to check out browser compatibility of `EventSource`. At the moment it doesn't implemented in any versions of IE.

By default every 3000ms a handshake message will be sent to the client to not allow a browser lose a connection. Handshake message is just a comment that will not be caught by any of `EventSource`'s events.
You can configure the interval by passing `handshake-interval` query when initializing event source:

```javascript
let eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:80/updates?handshake-interval=1000');
```

Or/and you can configure a handshake interval on server side:

```javascript
let sseExpress = require('./sse-express');
//...
app.use(sseExpress({handshakeInterval: 1000}));
```

The same way you can configure a reconnection time (3000ms by default) after which browser will try to restore a connection if it is lost:

```javascript
// fron-end setup
let eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:80/updates?retry=1000');

// or back-end setup
let sseExpress = require('./sse-express');
//...
app.use(sseExpress({retry: 1000}));
```

The priority of choosing which option to be used is (from low to high priority):

1. Default value
2. Server config
3. Client's query

# API
#### res.sse(evt, json, id)
`evt` - is event name
`json` - object that will be sent as json string to a client
`[id]` - optional id of event

#### res.sse.lastEventId
Property which contains either `Last-Event-Id` header or `lastEventId` query parameter. Normally it's sent by browser in request headers. 
But not all (almost all) browsers do such. That's why middleware also can read query parameter `lastEventId`. 

Every time `res.sse` called with not empty `id` parameter `res.sse.lastEventId` will be replaced with this value.
